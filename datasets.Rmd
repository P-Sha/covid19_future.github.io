1. Spanish flu (Chicago):  [www.Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/thepodclub/spanish-flu-dataset)

Description: Data contains information on 8034 mortality cases, with "Unique Point Identifier (fid)", case type as pneumonia (1) or flu/unknown(0), point-location of each death(x(m) and y(m)), and week when death was recorded (as of 9/28/1918), for all the cases. Data recorded was for 7 weeks, which was during the [peak of the disease](cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/three-waves.htm).

Description: Data includes `r covid19_chicago_rawdf %>% nrow()` rows of dates and `r covid19_chicago_rawdf %>% ncol()` columns, date starting from 3/1/ 2020 to 11/22/2020. Data is collected for total cases, total deaths and total hospitalizations for each day, and stratified by age groups, sex, and ethnicity  for all the cases, deaths and hospitalizations.

Description: Data contains `r read.csv("./data/sars_2003_complete_dataset_clean.csv")%>% nrow()` rows of areas (a country or countries grouped by regions), and 12 columns of cumulative cases by sex and their total, median age, by status of cases (hospitalized, recovered, daily deaths, and case-fatality ratios), number of imported cases, occupationally exposed cases (health care workers), and dates of first probable and last probable case. 

Case fatality recorded was based on cases with known outcome, irrespective of immediate cause of death.


4. H1N1 + Influenza B: [apps.who.int/flumart](https://apps.who.int/flumart/Default?ReportNo=12)

Description: Data is available by a country or region, with range of years (starting with 1995) and range of weeks selected. It includes weekly information on the type of flu virus (A or B) detected by subtypes of five in group A and 3 in group B, total number of positive cases, total of flu-negative cases, and ILI (Influenza like Illness). ILI activity is recorded as regional, local or sporadic outbreak,  with “no report” for in many countries. Our dataset for H1N1 contained `r #h1n1_df %>% nrow()` rows and `r #h1n1_df %>% ncol()` columns. Our dataset for Inlfuenza B contained `r #influenza_df %>% nrow()` rows and `r #influenza_df %>% ncol()` columns.


5. COVID-19 Deaths (USA): [data.cdc.gov](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-COVID-19-Death-Counts-by-Week-Ending-D/r8kw-7aab)
