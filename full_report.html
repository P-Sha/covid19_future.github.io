<div id="motivation-and-goals" class="section level3">
<h3>Motivation and Goals</h3>
<p>As of the beginning of November 2020, the total deaths due to COVID-19 surpassed <a href="https://covid19.who.int/">1.3 million</a> globally. Further, as reported by WHO, the total confirmed cases exceeded 57.8 million worldwide.</p>
<div id="motivation" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Motivation</em></h4>
<p>Given the scale of this pandemic, the project was inspired by the idea of trying to understand its direction by comparing it to prior pandemics. With uncertainty and anxiety accompanying it, and no definitive foreseeable future, we were interested in exploring how the previous similar pandemics, caused by similar pathogens, turned out over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="goals" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Goals</em></h4>
<p>By undertaking this project, we were hoping to identify and establish any existing pattern in past outbreaks, and then to look for predictability in possible direction(s) COVID-19 could turn to in the near future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level3">
<h3>Related Work</h3>
<p>The idea for the project was encouraged by the articles <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02278-5">“How the pandemic might play out in 2021 and beyond”</a>, and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-pandemic-future-scenarios.html">“Here’s how the COVID-19 pandemic could play out over the next two years”</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="questions" class="section level3">
<h3>Questions</h3>
<div id="initial" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Initial</em></h4>
<p>The questions of interest were to investigate on the expected severity of COVID-19 based on information provided by prior pandemics, and to predict the length and direction of the current pandemic based on the history of similar infectious pandemics. Evaluation of time-series was the primary focus of the project, intially.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Additional</em></h4>
<p>What might the basic reproductive rates had been in the past pandemics? Basic reproductive rate, or <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> for short, is a measure that describes the ability of a pathogen to spread in a population. It is the average of secondary infections caused by an infectious individual; which we thought is a critical element in pandemics analyses.</p>
<p><strong>[How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?]</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="data" class="section level3">
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Multiple datasets were used from various shareable online sources for analysis and comparison to COVID-19. Complete list of data-descriptions is provided under the “Datasets” tab.</p>
<p>Most of the datasets were available in ready-to-use CSV formats, requiring some basic manipulations to get them in a readable and tidy format. Since up-to-date data is important in analysis of prior pandemic trends, data scraping from <a href="data.cdc.gov">the CDC website</a> for updated COVID-19 data was used. Data scraping was done using JSON APIs with the <code>GET</code> function from the <code>httr</code> package, along with the <code>fromJSON()</code> function from the <code>jsonlite</code> package.</p>
<p><brk><brk><brk></p>
<p>Data for COVID-19 in Chicago required filtering the peak timeframe, up until the completion of this report (December 4th 2020), by weeks. This combined dataframe was then compared to the available Spanish flu record of 7 weeks.</p>
<p><brk><brk><brk></p>
<p>Also, the data with <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> and other statistical comparisons between the four pandemics was extracted by scraping <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30484-9/fulltext">thelancet.com</a>. Scraped data first had to be saved as a dataframe in order to make it compatible with the rest of the website. Information on <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> for the four pandemics, incubation period, interval between symptoms to infectivity, and proportion with mild illness was retained and formatted into a table. Data was again reformatted to long in order to show <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> by disease-type graphically.</p>
<p><brk><brk><brk></p>
<p>After the preliminary steps were taken to get the datasets in working forms, all the data files were then stored in <code>.rda</code> compressed format for easy access and reproducibility across the site.</p>
<p><brk><brk><brk></p>
<p>In order to create a choropleth world map of disease cases, country polygon data was obtained from <a href="https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json">this GitHub repo</a>. The file was read in using function <code>geojson_read()</code> from the <code>geojsonio</code> package. For COVID-19, H1N1, and SARS, the cumulative cases and cumulative deaths for each country were taken and combined into 1 large dataframe. This dataframe was then merged with the spatial json file matched by country name using <code>merge()</code> function from <code>sp</code> package.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploratory-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploratory Analysis</h3>
<p>Given the rapidly changing dynamics on a daily basis of the current Coronavirus, the analysis of COVID-19 would understandably need an ongoing update as well for a complete and thorough comparisons. Nevertheless, the comparisons did provide some understanding on how pandemics shape out in general, and helped relieve some anxiety and uncertainty regarding them. Hopefully, it will do the same for our readers.</p>
<p><brk><brk><brk></p>
<p>We started our analysis by comparing the first pandemic of the 20th century, named Spanish flu, which has its descendant virus remaining till today as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187799/">influenza virus</a>. Although the first historically documented pandemic was the Plague of 430 B.C., not much of the recorded data is available for pandemics prior to the 20th century. Recently, efforts have been made to understand the disease history by studying remnants of human remains such as the teeth. Paleontologists and scientists have identified the DNA of the bacteria that caused the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/ancient-teeth-show-history-of-epidemics-is-much-older-than-we-thought/2020/07/24/4f18ed94-b641-11ea-a8da-693df3d7674a_story.html">Black Death pandemic over 5,000 years ago</a>.<br />

<div id="spanish-flu" class="section level4">
<h4>Spanish Flu</h4>
<p>Spanish flu was a viral infection just as COVID-19, which lasted from early 1918 to spring of 1920. With the data available, or lack of, we were able to compare its impact in Chicago. Data was recorded at the peak of the outbreak, for 7 weeks. For parallel comparison, data was extracted for peak 7 weeks as well for COVID-19, from the City of Chicago databank.</p>

<p>Next we compared the first pandemic of the 21st century, Severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS-2003 for short, to COVID-19. With better records of data collection and availability by then, we were able to analyze the history of SARS at a global scale and were able to compare it to COVID-19 at a greater detail.</p>

<p>As the graph displays, SARS was a global pandemic, with majority of death toll in eastern part of the world such as China and Hong Kong. A fast-spreading albeit short-lived pandemic, it was contained within 5 months for the most part. According to the <a href="htts://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html">CDC</a>, the first reported case was in February of 2003 in Asia.</p>
<p>In contrast to COVID-19, SARS did not spread as widely in the western countries, or much at all in the U.S.</p>

<p>Distinct difference in the scale of cumulative cases is evident in the two graphs, along with the rise in cases for a given duration of time. SARS, although spiked steeply early on, tapered off within a few months. COVID-19 meanwhile stayed at an exponential growth for the first 300 days of onset.</p>
<p>SARS was a relatively lethal virus with a high case fatality rate compared with other viral respiratory pathogens. Below, we illustrate the global cumulative mortality burden over the duration of the pandemic.</p>

<p>The first viral respiratory disease outbreak of the 21st century classified as a pandemic by the WHO was the influenza H1N1 outbreak of 2009-2010. A novel strain of influenza A, H1N1 pdm09 was the result reassortment across pig species (hence “swine” flu) and resulted in antigenic shift with high resultant susceptibility to infection among the human population.</p>

<p>Similar discrepancies in overall mortality are appreciated on the global scale.

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Comparison of the current COVID-19 pandemic with prior viral respiratory pathogen outbreaks reveal the severity of the current outbreak in terms of both global and US-specific incident cases and mortality burden. It helps put the scale of COVID-19 in perspective relative to prior similar pandemics.</p>
<p>seemingly apart at first glance, study revealed some common interesting characteristics about pandemics. Cumulative cases for both SARS and H1N1 followed a logistic s-curve, fitting the spread of a disease through a healthy susceptible population. Such patterns reveal initial exponential growth, until the exhaustion of susceptible cases.</p>
<p>That the new cases run in wave(s) was also evident. Lack of Spanish flu data restricted its analysis, however the image below from CDC show that it ran its course globally in 3 waves.</p>
<div id="spanish-flu-waves-cdc" class="section level5">
<h5><em>Spanish flu waves (CDC)</em></h5>
<p><img src="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/images/death-chart.jpg" /></p>
<p>Another interesting aspect of the Chicago Spanish flu dataset was that more people died from a secondary bacterial infection than the actual flu, indicating that the viral-bacterial co-pathogen complications were more prevalent than the primary viral disease itself. The findings reveal that we probably need to look beyond a pandemic’s primary cause for better planning and outcomes.</p>
<p>Questions remain whether COVID-19 would turn into an endemic just as H1N1 did and Spanish flu did with its descendant virus, or fade out with time as SARS 2003 did? Third option seems less probable given COVID’s duration and geographic spread. With many questions unanswered at this point, with the ongoing data-updates globally, a peak into past pandemics provided a better understanding into such probable courses of current Corona virus.</p>
<p>In conclusion, COVID-19 is certainly not the first pandemic, and probably not the last. Looking at past pandemics could give us some main takeaways for better preparedness and management. Researching about these past pandemics have taught us that certain non-medical measures did work in the past. For instance, according to "<a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/comparing-covid-19-with-previous-pandemics#1918:-The-Spanish-flu">Medical News Today"</a>, quick implementation of social-distancing and masking was effective during Spanish flu. Quarantine measures were highly effective during the SARS 2003 outbreak. More importantly, we are medically and scientifically better equipped than we were in the past, to bring the <span class="math inline">\(R_0\)</span> number below one. At the end, pandemics do come to an end.</p>
