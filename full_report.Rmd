### Motivation and Goals

As of the beginning of November 2020, the total deaths due to COVID-19 surpassed [1.3 million](https://covid19.who.int/) globally. Further, as reported by WHO, the total confirmed cases exceeded 57.8 million worldwide. 

#### _Motivation_

Given the scale of this pandemic, this project was inspired by the idea to try and make some sense of it by comparing it to prior pandemics. Wth uncertainty and anxiety accompanying it, and no definitive known direction to its future, we were interested in exploring how the previous similar pandemics, caused by similar pathogens, turned out over time.       

#### _Goals_

By undertaking this project, we were hoping to identify and establish any existing pattern in past outbreaks, and then to look for predictability in possible direction(s) COVID-19 could turn to in the near future. 

### Related work

The idea for the project was encouraged by the articles ["How the pandemic might play out in 2021 and beyond"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02278-5), and ["Here's how the COVID-19 pandemic could play out over the next two years"](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-pandemic-future-scenarios.html).

### Questions

#### _Initial_

The questions of interest were to investigate on the expected severity of COVID-19 based on information provided by prior pandemics, and to predict the length and direction of the current pandemic based on the history of similar infectious pandemics. Evaluation of time-series was the primary focus of the project, intially.

#### _Additional_

What might the basic reproductive rates had been in the past pandemics? Basic reproductive rate, or "r0" for short, is a measure that describes the ability of a pathogen to spread in a population. It is the average of secondary infections caused by an infectious individual; which we thought is a critical element in pandemics analyses.  

[How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?]

### Data

Multiple datasets were used from various shareable online sources for analysis and comparison to COVID-19. Complete list of data-descriptions is provided under the "Datasets" tab. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
Most of the datasets were available in ready-to-use CSV formats, so we built dataframes using the `read_csv` function. The SARS-2003 dataset, however, was transformed from a PDF file to an updated "cleaner" CSV version. Furthermore, since up-to-date data is important in analysis of prior pandemic trends, data scraping from [the CDC website](data.cdc.gov) for updated COVID-19 data was used. Data scraping was done using JSON APIs with the `GET` function from the `httr` package, along with the `fromJSON()` function from the `jsonlite` package.

  Also, the data with R0 and other statistical comparisons between the four pandemics was extracted by scraping [thelancet.com](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(20)30484-9/fulltext). Information on R0 for the four pandemics, incubation period, interval between symptoms to infectivity, and proportion with mild illness was retained and formatted into a table. Data was again reformatted to long in order to show r0 by disease-type graphically.
