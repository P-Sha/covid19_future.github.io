### Motivation and Goals

As of the beginning of November 2020, the total deaths due to COVID-19 surpassed [1.3 million](https://covid19.who.int/) globally. Further, as reported by WHO, the total confirmed cases exceeded 57.8 million worldwide. 

#### _Motivation_

Given the scale of this pandemic, this project was inspired by the idea to try and make some sense of it by comparing it to prior pandemics. Wth uncertainty and anxiety accompanying it, and no definitive known direction to its future, we were interested in exploring how the previous similar pandemics, caused by similar pathogens, turned out over time.       

#### _Goals_

By undertaking this project, we were hoping to identify and establish any existing pattern in past outbreaks, and then to look for predictability in possible direction(s) COVID-19 could turn to in the near future. 

### Related work

The idea for the project was encouraged by the articles ["How the pandemic might play out in 2021 and beyond"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02278-5), and ["Here's how the COVID-19 pandemic could play out over the next two years"](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-pandemic-future-scenarios.html).

### Questions

#### _Initial_

The questions of interest were to investigate on the expected severity of COVID-19 based on information provided by prior pandemics, and to predict the length and direction of the current pandemic based on the history of similar infectious pandemics.

#### _Additional_

Over the course of the project...

### Data

Multiple datasets were used from various shareable online sources for analysis and comparison to COVID-19. Complete list of data-descriptions is provided under the "Datasets" tab. 
  Although most of the datasets were available in ready to use CSV format, sars-2003 data was transformed from a pdf file to an updated "cleaner" CSV version.
