### Introduction to the Project

According to [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/story/US_cu_4Rjdh3ABAABMHM_en) , coronavirus is one of the most searched topics of 2020, surpassing "news" four times in the search history between March and May. Living through a running pandemic, what might the most googled phobia be? Due to COVID-19, it is ["the fear of other people"](https://nypost.com/2020/10/15/most-googled-phobia-of-2020-is-fear-of-other-people-amid-covid-19/
). So the question on most peoples' mind, it is safe to assume, is how would COVID-19 take its course in the near future and possibly beyond?

### Project Report

Given the nature of new Zoonotic infectious diseases, and the resulting inconsistent and sometimes conflicting measures of management via our current federal government surrounding COVID-19, we thought it would be interesting to explore into past pandemics in an effort to read a bit into the current one. The idea was encouraged by the articles ["How the pandemic might play out in 2021 and beyond"](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02278-5), and ["Here's how the COVID-19 pandemic could play out over the next two years"](https://www.livescience.com/covid-19-pandemic-future-scenarios.html). 

The questions of interest were to investigate on the expected severity of COVID-19 based on information provided by prior pandemics, and to predict the length and direction of the current pandemic based on the history of similar infectious pandemics.

#### Data





### Proposal

 
Primary data sources would be from website kaggle.com, along with cdc.gov and who.int for covid19 data.
[(Example of kaggle dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/thepodclub/spanish-flu-dataset)

Data comparisons would be performed between past pandemics and the current pandemic using parallel datasets, by analyzing statistical parameters and their visual graphics. Challenges would be to find data on some historical pandemics from time period when data collection was not well established, along with finding current complete data on the pandemic which is still in the running.
